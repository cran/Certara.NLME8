Description: Perform Nonlinear Mixed-Effects (NLME) Modeling using Certara's
    NLME-Engine. Access the same Maximum Likelihood engines used in the Phoenix
    platform, including algorithms for parametric methods, individual, and pooled
    data analysis <https://www.certara.com/app/uploads/2020/06/BR_PhoenixNLME-v4.pdf>.
    The Quasi-Random Parametric Expectation-Maximization Method (QRPEM) is also
    supported <https://www.page-meeting.org/default.asp?abstract=2338>. Execution
    is supported both locally or on remote machines. Remote execution includes
    support for Linux Sun Grid Engine (SGE), Terascale Open-source Resource and
    Queue Manager (TORQUE) grids, Linux and Windows multicore, and individual runs.
